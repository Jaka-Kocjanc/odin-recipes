In this project I will put to test the first few lessons of HTML that Odin has given me.
I will be using:

- Unordered and ordered lists
- Headings
- Anchors
- Images
- Basic HTML tags

> Even though I am already fairly familliar with all of the stuff listed above
> I will still to be my best to follow the rules of The Odin Project.
